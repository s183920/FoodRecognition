# What are the 3 notebooks for?

If you're having trouble with cython, coco or other dependencies try running the dependencies part of the first notebook. <br>

A pretrained model can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eqj1dcnDcjguICUyLHNfflyZsmF3BNA9/view?usp=sharing).

## FoodRec
This notebook was used for training a model and can be used both with and without bayesian optimisation. <br>
This notebook can be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13KQoEpEG8vP76_OXHPJjgqI6lOxsaLxY?usp=sharing)

## FoodRec_validation
This notebook was used to evaluate models obtained in the previous steps. <br>
This notebook can be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Cp-C6Kgm40bAoovCP5dkBNd15dHk4Sk6?usp=sharing)

## FoodRec_demo
This notebook is a demo of some of the bounding box outputs by the model. This can both be used with the given data set or with a random image from the internet. <br>
